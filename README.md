## 👨‍💻 About Me  
As a former Network Operations Center (NOC) Analyst with over 4.5 years of experience in IT infrastructure monitoring and incident response, I’ve developed a strong foundation in maintaining system health and supporting business-critical operations. During my time at American Infosource, I worked with a dedicated team responsible for supporting Cadence Bank’s backend operations — we consistently achieved a 94% ticket resolution rate, reflecting both technical expertise and team coordination.

I’ve been recognized multiple times for my work ethic and commitment, including a Certificate of Appreciation from Cadence Bank, along with internal accolades such as Rising Star Performer and Star Performer of the Month.

Now based in Canada, I’m advancing my skills through a postgraduate certificate in Business Analytics at Niagara College, after completing a diploma in FinTech at Conestoga College. I’m actively working on data-driven projects using tools like Power BI, Excel, Python, and R, and I’m eager to bridge my IT experience with analytics to support smarter decision-making and operational efficiency.

### 2. AI Career Counseling (Capstone – Project Manager)  
Project: Edumentor – AI-Powered Career Guidance Platform (Capstone Project)
Business Analytics | Niagara College

This was a hypothetical business idea I developed as part of my capstone project at Niagara College. Edumentor is designed as a secure, AI-powered platform to guide Canadians through personalized career paths—whether they’re students choosing education streams or mid-career professionals navigating transitions.

- Key areas of research and analysis included:
- Understanding automation anxiety and the need for personalized upskilling
- Market trends in AI adoption, online career services, and lifelong learning
- Gaps in traditional career counseling and job board platforms
- Competitive positioning and ethical AI practices
- Adherence to Canadian data privacy laws (PIPEDA)

The project offered deep insights into user behavior, strategic positioning, and how AI can reshape career planning. While the platform remains a conceptual idea, the research process mirrored real-world product strategy and market analysis.
